            <h2>Risky Way</h2>
            <p>Risky Way is a free instant game. The highways <span><br /></span> of the future are risky and if you want to <span><br /></span> survive you'll need to be smarter than all of <span><br /></span> them combined. All you have to do in this <span><br /></span> nerve-tingling racing game is click, hold, and let <span><br /></span> go. Of course, if you want to be an effective <span><br /></span> driver who is able to survive you'll have to <span><br /></span> know when to click, how long to hold, <span><br /></span>  and only let go at the appropriate time.</p>
